# HaploMerger2

HaploMerger2 (HM2) is an important upgrade over HaploMerger.

HM2 is an effective, easy-to-use, automated pipeline. It is designed to untangle allelic relations between haplotype sequences in a highly-polymorphic diploid assembly, and then reconstruct and output two separated haploid sub-assemblies, the reference (the better one) and the alternative.

HM2 also implements hierachical re-scaffolding on haploid assembly, corrections for major misjoins and corrections for tandem mis-assemblies.
